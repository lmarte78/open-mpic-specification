# open-mpic-specification
This is the Open API specification for the Open Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration (open-mpic) project.

Please note: authentication is omitted from this specification. Authentication is left up to the CAs and the deployment environment and can typically be done with HTTP headers (e.g., `x-api-key` or `Authorization: Bearer`) that contain a secret which restricts access to the API.
